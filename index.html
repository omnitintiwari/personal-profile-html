        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As a resilient entrepreneur, I've navigated various experiments in
          business, embracing failures and learning from each step. My journey
          began with dropshipping, followed by launching a watch brand and home
          essentials brand, where I gained valuable insights despite facing
          challenges. However, it was with my clothing brand, Xylozoom, that I
          found momentum. I built my first website with my mentor's guidance and
          later invested in marketing agency services, which drove sales but
          with a low ROAS. Determined to optimize my approach, I took a course
          on Meta Ads and enhanced my advertising skills. Yet, I realized the
          importance of organic sales and sustainable growth. This led me to the
          Institute of Venture Building, where I embarked on a transformative
          journey of entrepreneurship. Through my experiences, I've developed a
          unique blend of creative problem-solving, adaptability, and strategic
          thinking.
