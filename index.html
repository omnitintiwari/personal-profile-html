            <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>
                As a resilient entrepreneur, I've navigated various experiments in business, embracing failures and learning from each step. My journey began with dropshipping, followed by launching a watch brand and home essentials brand, where I gained valuable insights despite facing challenges.

However, it was with my clothing brand, Xylozoom, that I found momentum. I built my first website with my mentor's guidance and later invested in marketing agency services, which drove sales but with a low ROAS.

Determined to optimize my approach, I took a course on Meta Ads and enhanced my advertising skills. Yet, I realized the importance of organic sales and sustainable growth.

This led me to the Institute of Venture Building, where I embarked on a transformative journey of entrepreneurship. I'm thrilled to say that this decision has been pivotal in shaping my success.

Through my experiences, I've developed a unique blend of creative problem-solving, adaptability, and strategic thinking. I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and collaborating with like-minded individuals to drive innovation and growth.
